# HeartBreaker
This library is for manipulating ECG signals to find meaningful statistics

## Phase Space Data
This shows where the P, Q, S and T peaks are relative to the R-R intervals. This is done by finding the time distance between the peak and the current R peak and dividing it by the R-R interval for that particular heartbeat. 

For the image below the mean of all the peak ratios are ploted along with their standard deviation by muiltiplying the ratios by 2<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\pi"> inorder to make the ratios angles.
